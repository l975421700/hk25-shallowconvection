# Unlocking the climate puzzle: tackling uncertainty in marine low clouds  <img src='https://21centuryweather.org.au/wp-content/uploads/Hackathon-Image-WCRP-Positive-1536x736.jpg' align="right" height="139" />

Low clouds are the greatest source of uncertainty in climate projections. While current climate models are too corse to resolve clouds and rely on parameteristions, km-resolution climate simulations start to resolve deep convection and potentially also shallow convection. However, it is not yet clear how much cloud simulations can be improved for actionable climate projections. This project aims to explore these questions, specifically:
1) How do km-resolution climate models represent TOA upward shortwave radiation and low clouds compared to satellite products (CERES and Himawari)?
2) How can we make more physics-informed cloud visualization for qualitative comparisons with satellite images?
